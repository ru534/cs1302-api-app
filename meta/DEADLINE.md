## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

The app provides weather & temperature of the location inputted by the user. Users can choose World or US (default is world) and enter city name and country/state name(optional).
    The app will return current temperature, weather, minimum temp, maximum temp, and what is feels like(temperature). The first API is geocoding api from API Ninja, which returns
    longitudes and latitues of the inputted city name(required) and country/state name(optional). The second API is API from OpenWeather, which takes in longitude and latitude and returns
    the weather at that location. The geocoding api takes in city name, returns longitude/latitude, and OpenWeather API takes in that result to return weather.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

It was very fun to make a app from scratch. There were many thing that could be customized, making me creative.
    This creative process was fun. I also learned how apps we use daily are well made. I realized how hard to make and provide such application.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I might add more things for better user experience. I think I could expand more on my app, making it a better app for use.
    I look forward on getting more experience with programming and getting better with making things.
